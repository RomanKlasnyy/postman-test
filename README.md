# postman-test

Simple Flask API (calculator), which you can test using Postman:

  - Download the folder, create venv with packages, given in `requirements.txt`
  - Open app.py and run it (it runs a local server that can be tested manually)
  - Import `.json` file to Postman and run the tests (wow, there are 27 in the file!)
